- xfs fixes from upstream:
  * don't serialise direct IO reads on page cache checks
    (fixes performance regression introduced in 2.6.38)
  * avoid direct I/O write vs buffered I/O race
  * return -EIO when xfs_vn_getattr() failed
  * fix buffer flushing during unmount
  * fix possible memory corruption in xfs_readlink
  * use doalloc flag in xfs_qm_dqattach_one()
