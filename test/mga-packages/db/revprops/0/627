- Use display_driver_helper to load display drivers. It checks the
  drivers it knows so that the X.org configuration is appropriate for
  the driver before loading it. I.e. if "vesa" is enabled, no display
  drivers are loaded, and if "fglrx" is enabled "radeon" is not loaded,
  and vice versa, etc. Also, no wrong version dkms binary driver is
  loaded if the correct dkms source driver is going to be built later
  during this boot.
- When in initrd, instead of using display_driver_helper, instead check
  for the nokmsboot and failsafe boot parameters, and load drivers if
  neither is set (note: initrds do not contain proprietary drivers).
