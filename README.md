# svn-2-dist-git

## Summary

This repo contains scripts to migrate Mageia's packaging SVN repos to [Fedora's dist-git](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Dist_Git_Project).
It's a part of the efforts to migrate the whole package tooling from Subversion to Git. The entire process is described [here](https://bugs.mageia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=20351).
