- Numerous upstream cherry picks
- Drop usless Mandriva patch (we didn't use what it added)
- Ensure network filesystems will hold up DM only when 'nofail' is omitted in fstab
- Do not make DM wait for rc.local (we don't do thus under sysvinit)
- Make the DM failure script start later if it runs
- Fix small cosmetic issue in systemd-analyse when run too quickly after boot
- Note: journalctl and loginctl have now dropped their systemd- prefix
