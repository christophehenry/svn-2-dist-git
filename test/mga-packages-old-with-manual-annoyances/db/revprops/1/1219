- update to 3.1.6
- drop patch DS01 (merged)
- trigger dkms build in posttrans so modules get built at kernel install
  instead of at boot (speeds up boot time with new kernel)
- update desktop(586) & laptop summaries and descriptions to point out that
  only 3-3.5GB RAM is detected on 32bit, and that server kernel is needed to
  fully support 4GB or more
- switch transparent hugepages from on by default to madvise (only enabled
  for apps that requests it), as it fixes desktop freeze when accessing
  slow media such as usb (thanks to fbui/mdv mail on @cooker ml).
